# Parole
Remake of a very old DOS game to learn English-Russian words.

Game is a simple way to make learning English words more fun. You are given a Russian translation of the word and a hint of English word with some letters missing. You have to input the missing letters from the keyboard.

# Add your words
List of words can be edited in parole.txt. Add your words in the end. If you delete or change order of the words, you have to delete `parole.sco` to reset the words scores.
